## Overview
Synta is a **local-first visual editor** for building **websites and React components** with real-time code sync baked in. Think Figma or Framer, but for your codebase, running locally, with zero lock-in.

Designers can visually craft beautiful UIs in a familiar interface. Developers get instantly updated, production-ready JSX/TSX. No rebuilds, no handoffs, no guesswork. Everyone saves time. Everyone wins.

And the best part? It’s free forever for solo devs and small teams.

### Who's It For 🎯? 
- **Solo devs & indie makers** who want to move fast without bloated workflows
- **Small hybrid teams** (1–3 people) who design and build together
- **Designers** frustrated with handoffs and rebuilds
- **Developers** tired of building a UI after it's "complete"
- **Anyone** building React-based websites or components

### What Can You Do With It 🚀?
- Visually create full websites or components, **no code** required
- Visually edit your **existing React project/components** and auto-sync changes to disk
- Ship faster, collaborate smoother, and keep full ownership of your code

### What’s in This Repo 📦?
This repo contains the **Electron-based desktop application** that powers the Synta visual editor. It includes:
- The app shell (built with Electron + React + Vite)
- The visual editor interface

> [!NOTE]
> Other parts of the project (like Synta Core) may live in separate repos.

  No, Synta uses an ultra fast Rust algorithm to turn your visual components into TSX. It then uses SWC in memory to visualize your components instantly in the previewer.
